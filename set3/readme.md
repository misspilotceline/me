TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week, I have learned several important concepts and techniques in programming. First, I gained a good understanding of how to use the try-except loop for error handling, which allows me to gracefully handle potential errors in my code. Additionally, I discovered the usefulness of the list(range()) function, which helps me generate lists of numbers efficiently.

One of the main challenges I faced this week was the guessing game exercise and the implementation of the binary search algorithm. It took me a significant amount of time to work through the exercises and understand the logic behind them. I encountered some difficulties in exercise 3, and exercise 4 was particularly challenging for me to grasp fully.

Despite the challenges, I believe I have made progress in my coding skills throughout the week. Working on these exercises has improved my problem-solving abilities and my understanding of Python programming. I am determined to continue practicing and deepening my knowledge to become more proficient in coding.
